# MyTalkGPT
Train Your Own Simple / Easy / Toy LLM

AI (Artificial Intelligence) training world uses a lot of words. LLM Training programs try to produce interesting or advanced AI.

MyTalkGPT is a training program that is easy to understand, 










## What kind of LLM will this training produce?

This code implements a GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model that is inspired by GPT-2, but it's significantly smaller and less capable than the actual GPT-2. Let's break down the key differences and how close it is:

Similarities to ChatGPT (GPT-2):

    Architecture: The core architecture is very similar. It uses:

        Transformer Blocks: The fundamental building block is a stack of transformer decoder layers, just like GPT-2.

        Multi-Head Self-Attention: The attention mechanism is multi-headed, allowing the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence in parallel.

        Causal Masking: The attention mechanism uses a causal mask, ensuring that the model can only attend to past tokens, preventing it from "cheating" by looking at future tokens during training and generation.

        Feed-Forward Networks: Each transformer block contains a feed-forward network (with GELU activation, which is correct for GPT-2).

        Layer Normalization: Layer normalization is used before the attention and feed-forward layers (pre-norm), which is the modern and more stable configuration. GPT-2 originally used post-norm, but later models (and best practices) switched to pre-norm.

        Token and Position Embeddings: The model uses learned embeddings for both tokens (words) and positions (where the word appears in the sequence).

        Weight Initialization: The code includes a weight initialization scheme similar to GPT-2's.

        Training Loop: The train function implements a standard training loop with backpropagation, gradient clipping, and a learning rate scheduler.

        Generation: The generate function uses top-k sampling, a common technique for generating text with language models. It also correctly handles the context length during generation.

        Tokenizer: It uses the GPT2Tokenizer from the transformers library, which is crucial. This means it's using the same vocabulary and tokenization method as GPT-2, ensuring compatibility at the input/output level.

        Dataset Class: The TextDataset class shows good best practice by using the same tokenizer.

Key Differences and How They Impact Closeness:

    Model Size (The Biggest Difference):

        embedding_dim=384: GPT-2 (small) uses embedding_dim=768. GPT-2 (medium) uses 1024, large uses 1280, and XL uses 1600. The embedding dimension is the size of the hidden state, and it's a major factor in model capacity. This model's embedding dimension is half the size of even the smallest GPT-2.

        num_layers=6: GPT-2 (small) uses num_layers=12. Medium uses 24, large uses 36, and XL uses 48. The number of layers is another huge factor. This model has half the layers of the smallest GPT-2.

        num_heads=6: GPT-2 (small) uses num_heads=12. This is directly tied to the embedding_dim. Since embedding_dim is halved, num_heads is also halved to keep the head dimension consistent.

        context_length = 512 While GPT-2's official context length is 1024, this model's context is reduced to 512. This is important for memory usage.

    Impact: These size differences are enormous. The model capacity (its ability to learn complex patterns in the data) is drastically reduced compared to even the smallest GPT-2 model. It will be much less coherent, have a much poorer understanding of language, and struggle with longer-range dependencies. A rough estimate: the parameter count of this model is about 1/8 the size of GPT-2 small.

    Training Data and Time:

        The code includes a train function, but it's configured for a relatively small number of epochs (max_epochs=50) and a small batch size (batch_size=4). GPT-2 was trained for a vastly longer time on a massive dataset (WebText, which is many gigabytes of text).

        The books_trimmed_500mb.txt file is much smaller than the datasets used to train GPT-2. 500MB is still a reasonable dataset size for this model.

        Impact: Even if the architecture were identical, the limited training data and time would result in a model far less capable than GPT-2. The model will likely overfit to this smaller dataset and won't generalize as well.

    Optimizer and Learning Rate:

        The code uses AdamW with a learning rate of 5e-5 and a cosine annealing scheduler. These are reasonable choices, but the optimal hyperparameters would depend on the dataset and model size. GPT-2's training used carefully tuned learning rate schedules.

        Impact: While the optimizer choice is good, the learning rate might not be optimal. However, the impact is less significant than the model size and training data differences.

    Early Stopping:

        The provided training loop correctly implements early stopping, an important practice.

    Gradient Clipping:

        Implemented, and an important practice for stable training.

Overall Closeness:

The code implements a model that shares the fundamental architecture of GPT-2, but it's a much smaller and less powerful model. It's best described as a "mini-GPT" or a "GPT-2-like" model. It's a good starting point for learning about transformers and language models, but it won't produce results comparable to even the smallest released GPT-2 model. Think of it as a scaled-down, simplified version designed for educational purposes or experimentation on smaller datasets.

In Summary:

    Architecturally: Very similar in terms of the core components (transformer blocks, attention, etc.).

    Capacity: Significantly smaller and less capable due to reduced embedding_dim, num_layers, and num_heads.

    Training: Designed for much shorter training on smaller datasets.

    Performance: Will be far less coherent and knowledgeable than any of the official GPT-2 models.

It's much closer to a "toy" GPT-2 than a production-ready language model. But it's an excellent, well-written, and well-commented codebase for learning and experimentation! The use of the transformers tokenizer and the overall structure are excellent starting points.
